Plugins
=============================

The tutorials will lead you through creating a set of successively more sophisticated plugins for heedy.

Each tutorial builds upon the previous one's material, so it is important to go in order.

The full code for each of the tutorials can be seen in the `examples directory <https://github.com/heedy/heedy/tree/master/examples/plugins>`_.
