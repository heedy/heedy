   The documentation is currently under construction. A first version is expected to be released with 0.4.0-alpha.3.
   Until then, expect many stub pages, as well as missing/incorrect content.

This documentation provides a description of heedy's features, as well as examples of their usage. Much of it is focused on programmers
and plugin-writers, to help them extend heedy.

.. warning::
   Heedy is currently in alpha. This means that some functionality described here might change before final 0.4.0 release.
